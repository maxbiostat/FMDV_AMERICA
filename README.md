## Abstract ([arXiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/1505.01105))

Although foot-and-mouth disease virus (FMDV) incidence has decreased in South America over the last years, the pathogen still circulates in the region and the risk of re-emergence in previously FMDV free areas is a public health concern. Here we merge environmental, epidemiological and genetic data to reconstruct spatiotemporal patterns and determinants of FMDV serotypes A and O dispersal in South America.
Our dating analysis suggests that serotype A emerged in South America by ≈ 1930, while serotype O ≈ 1990.
The rate of evolution was significantly higher for serotype O compared to serotype A.
Phylogeographic inference identified two well-connected sub networks of viral flow, one including Venezuela, Colombia and Ecuador; another including Brazil, Uruguay and Argentina.
The spread of serotype A was best described by geographic distances, while trade of live cattle was the strongest predictor of serotype O spread. Our findings show that the two serotypes have different underlying evolutionary and spatial dynamics and may pose different threats to control programmes.

Key-words: Phylogeography, foot-and-mouth disease virus, South America, animal trade.

**Migration networks for FMDV serotypes A and O in South America.**
We estimated the number of migration events between countries using the robust counting (Markov jumps) method.
Additionally, a separate analysis employing Bayesian Stochastic Search Variable Selection (BSSVS) was performed to determine most significant migration routes and Bayes factors are depicted by arrows, with line thickness proportional to BF magnitude.
We only plot BFs bigger than 3.
Coroplethic maps show the net migration rates for each country, for both serotypes.
From this it is clear that the pattern of spatial spread is different for both serotypes, although there is agreement on the likage between Venezuela and Colombia and Ecuador and Peru.
For serotype O, Bolivia stands out as a hub, while for serotype A Brazil is highly connected. Also notice that exchange rates (depicted by the colors) are considerably higher for serotype A.
