\section{Introduction}
The data sets used in this study presented high preferentiality of sampling, with some countries being overrepresented.
% A possibility, unexplored in this paper, is to sample each location with probability proportional to its disease prevalence
% In theory, a Bayesian approach should offer a certain degree of protection against model mispecification...
