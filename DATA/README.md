``DATA``

Sharing data is important, period. So here is pretty much all the data we collected for this paper. Due to its integrative nature, we have data from various sources/types.

**BEAST_OUTPUT**:
Contains processed output from BEAST, such as Bayes factors from BSSVS, state-change counts from Markov jumps, etc.

**EPI_DATA**:
Data on vaccination, outbreaks and livestock trade are here.

**REPORTS**:
These are reports from the Pan American Centre for Foot-and-mouth Disease (PANAFTOSA), which are available elsewhere on the internet, but are kept here to facilitate access.

**SEQUENCES**:
Holds .fasta alignments of the sequences used in this work. See Text S1 for metadata.

**XML**:
BEAST configuration files to boost reproducibility of our analyses.
