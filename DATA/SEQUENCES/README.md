## SEQUENCES 
This folder contains the aligments used in the study (`serotype_A_VP1.fasta` and `serotype_O_VP1.fasta`) and the original (unaligned) sequences.

In addition, we present maximum likelihood trees built with [PhyML](http://www.atgc-montpellier.fr/phyml/) using a HKY model with Gamma distributed site-rate heterogeneity (4 categories) and using best of SPR/NNI search.

Root-to-tip divergences (`RDV`) were computed using these trees and [Tempest](http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/tempest/).

[This](https://github.com/maxbiostat/FMDV_AMERICA/blob/master/CODE/root_to_tip_divergences.R) script plots the results, found [here](https://github.com/maxbiostat/FMDV_AMERICA/blob/master/FIGURES/PLOTS/rdvs.pdf).

See [data_acquisition/](https://github.com/maxbiostat/FMDV_AMERICA/tree/master/DATA/SEQUENCES/data_acquisition) for more details on how we constructed the data sets.
